        Hi, I&apos;m Jossif Elefteriadis. With over 9 years of development
        experience, I&apos;ve developed a diverse skill set spanning web and
        fullstack applications, blockchain technology, AI, CRM, and mobile
        application development.
        <br />
        <br /> In recent years, I&apos;ve focused on Developer Relations, where
        I excel in creating and delivering technical content. My work includes
        video tutorials that clarify complex blockchain topics like
        interoperability, smart contract portability, and consensus algorithms -
        and demonstrating how to use onchain APIs. I&apos;ve also been leading
        development of technical documentation, managing and nurturing a
        community of over 50,000 members, providing detailed feedback to
        engineers, and spearheading QA as well as PM initiatives.
