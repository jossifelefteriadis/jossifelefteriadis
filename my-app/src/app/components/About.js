        Hi, I&apos;m Jossif Elefteriadis. With over 9 years of development
        experience, I&apos;ve built a versatile skill set across web and
        fullstack applications, blockchain technology, AI, CRM systems, and
        mobile app development. My expertise spans both emerging technologies
        and enterprise solutions, driving innovative projects from concept to
        deployment.
        <br />
        <br /> In recent years, I&apos;ve specialized in Developer Relations,
        excelling in creating and delivering engaging technical content. My work
        spans video tutorials simplifying complex blockchain concepts like
        interoperability, smart contract portability, and consensus algorithms,
        while also showcasing onchain API integrations. I&apos;ve led the
        development of comprehensive technical documentation, managed and grown
        a community of 50,000+ members, provided actionable feedback to
        engineers, and driven key product management initiatives, from strategy
        to execution, ensuring alignment between technical teams and user
        experience goals.-
