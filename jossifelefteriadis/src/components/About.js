      I’ve always sought out opportunities and challenges that are meaningful to
      me.
      <br />
      <br />
      Although my professional path has taken many twists and turns — from small
      business owner and entrepreneur, to account manager and project manager —
      I've never stopped engaging my passion to help others and solve problems.
      <br />
      <br />
      As a fullstack developer, I enjoy using my creativity, my attention to
      details, and my mission-driven work ethic to somehow change the world.
      <br /> That's why I'm excited to make a big impact and be part of
      something meaningful.
